              Slum Art is committed to transforming lives in underserved
              communities through the transformative power of art and education.
              Our mission is to empower children and teenagers with limited
              access to resources, offering them a platform for self-expression,
              creativity, and education. By establishing innovative learning
              spaces, such as the Pet Bottle School, we aim to provide quality
              primary education and foster artistic talents. We believe in
              reducing waste and leaving a positive environmental footprint
              while guiding these young minds towards a brighter future. Through
              mentorship, community engagement, and initiatives like the
              Animation Hub, we aspire to break the cycle of poverty and open
              doors to opportunities in the tech and creative industries. Slum
              Art envisions a world where every individual, regardless of their
              background, has the chance to unleash their potential and
              contribute meaningfully to society.

              This CSR Capacity Building project is for the development of Slum
              Art Project associated with School of Art. Its mission is to
              mentor, restructure the mindset and to build up creative talent of
              children from the slum. These children will be put under thorough
              tutorship by creative art teachers to help develop their skills
              and in turn make income for themselves and their community. <br />
              <br />
              This project will have twenty intakes (children from ten slum)
              between ages ten to seventeen. They will undergo trainings from
              the School of Art. The training runs for a three months. Artworks
              will be made by each child every week which will be showcased in
              an exhibition put together by School of Art at the end of the one
              year.
              <br />
              <br />
              A sustainability model will be created around the Artworks and
              funds generated will be shared as 40% to community development,
              30% to the child artist to sustain his education and mental health
              and 20% goes to the sustainability/expansion of the Slum project
              and 10% for the art gallery who sales the painting.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the course of the one year training, each child has the benefit
              of mentorship from his trainee as well as one on one consultation.
              This gives the child a chance to a better mindset, orientation and
              fulfillment. Funding of this project will come from private
              sectors, individuals and international donors that are children
              and art-minded.
